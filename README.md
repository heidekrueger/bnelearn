# bnelearn: A Framework for Equilibrium Learning in Sealed-Bid Auctions
Authors: Stefan Heidekr√ºger, Paul Sutterer, Nils Kohring, Martin Bichler

Currently, this repository contains minimal code to reproduce the experiments in our forthcoming paper: "Learning Equilibria in Symmetric Auction Games using
Artificial Neural Networks". 

Over the next months, we will release the entire framework, so stay tuned.
